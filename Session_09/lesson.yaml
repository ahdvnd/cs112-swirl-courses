  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 9, CART. 
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!
      
- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we will build a simple decision tree together, and try to interpret it!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by loading the necessary library for making decision trees. 
      Load the "tree" library. Install it if you haven't done so.
  CorrectAnswer: library(tree)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library(tree)')
  Hint: To install, install.packages("tree"). To load, library(tree).

- Class: text
  Output: Our trusty lalonde dataset is automatically loaded in the beginning of the session.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's set a seed to make sure our tree turns out the same. Set seed to 112.
  CorrectAnswer: set.seed(112)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('set.seed(112)')
  Hint: Copy and paste, set.seed(112)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As data scientists, we should be comfortable with splitting data into training and test set.
      Use the sample() function to randomly select 100 indices as test set.
      Save the indices to an object called test.
  CorrectAnswer: test <- sample(1:nrow(lalonde), 100)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('test <- sample(1:nrow(lalonde), 100)', 'test = sample(1:445, 100)')
  Hint: To sample 5 numbers from 1-10, you would do sample(1:10, 5). See how you would modify this.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: With the indices generated above, let's extract the test set from the original lalonde dataset.
      Save the data frame to an object called lalonde.test.
  CorrectAnswer: lalonde.test <- lalonde[test,]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('lalonde.test <- lalonde[test,]')
  Hint: Make sure you include a comma in the [] to specify you want the rows.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now repeat this with the training set. A hint is to use the - operator.
  CorrectAnswer: lalonde.train <- lalonde[-test,]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('lalonde.train <- lalonde[-test,]')
  Hint: lalonde[-1,] means you want everything except the first row.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we are done with processing, we can make our decision tree! 
      Use the tree() function, which is similar in format as glm(), to make a decision tree.
      Save the tree to an object called tree.re75.
      The dependent variable is re75. Use everything except re75 and re78 as independent variables.
  CorrectAnswer: tree.re75 <- tree(re75 ~ .-re78, data=lalonde.train)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('tree.re75 <- tree(re75 ~ .-re78, data=lalonde.train)', 'tree.re75 <- tree(re75 ~ age + educ + black + hisp + married + nodegr + re74 + u74 + u75 + treat, data=lalonde.train)')
  Hint: Make sure you specify the data, we only want to use the training set here.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's take a look at the summary of our decision tree.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(tree.re75)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('summary(tree.re75)')
  Hint: Use summary(tree.re75)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can also plot our decision tree easily with plot() and text().
      Run plot(tree.re75)
  CorrectAnswer: plot(tree.re75)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('plot(tree.re75)')
  Hint: 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The plot is empty. We need to add text to the tree.
      Run text(tree.re75, pretty=0)
  CorrectAnswer: text(tree.re75, pretty=0)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('text(tree.re75, pretty=0)')
  Hint: 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the plot we made, which variables below is NOT used to make a decision in the tree?
  AnswerChoices: re74;u75;educ;married;age
  CorrectAnswer: age
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='age')
  Hint: The variable age is not used to classify in this decision tree.

- Class: text
  Output: Remember the test set we made at the beginning? 
      Let's compare the root-mean-squared-error (rmse) for our training set and test set.
      The calc_rmse is already loaded. The first argument is ytrue and the second is ypred.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's generate predictions from our training set using the decision tree.
      Save the predictions to an object called train.pred.
      Make sure you specify the type argument as "vector".
  CorrectAnswer: train.pred <- predict(tree.re75, lalonde.train, type="vector")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('train.pred <- predict(tree.re75, lalonde.train, type="vector")')
  Hint: train.pred <- predict([insert tree], [insert data], type="vector")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we can use the calc_rmse function to calculate the training set error.
  CorrectAnswer: calc_rmse(lalonde.train$re75, train.pred)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = calc_rmse(lalonde.train$re75, train.pred))
  Hint: Change this, calc_rmse(ytrue, ypred)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's do the same thing, but for the test set
      Save the predictions to an object called test.pred.
      Make sure you specify the type argument as "vector".
  CorrectAnswer: test.pred <- predict(tree.re75, lalonde.test, type="vector")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('test.pred <- predict(tree.re75, lalonde.test, type="vector")')
  Hint: test.pred <- predict([insert tree], [insert data], type="vector")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the calc_rmse function to calculate the test set error.
  CorrectAnswer: calc_rmse(lalonde.test$re75, test.pred)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = calc_rmse(lalonde.train$re75, test.pred))
  Hint: Change this, calc_rmse(ytrue, ypred)

- Class: text
  Output: Awesome job! In this lesson, we built a decision tree together. 
      We also analyzed its basic structure and evaluated the model with rmse.

  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"

  CorrectAnswer: NULL
