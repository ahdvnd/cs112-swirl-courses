  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 6, logistic regression. 
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

  Output: In this exercise, we'll be working with heart attack data from Kaggle.
      The data includes patients' data on the presence of heart disease 
      but also other characteristics such as demographic variables. We want to see
      how using a logistic regression we can predict the probability of having
      a heart disease given a person characteristics.

- Class: text
  Output: The data is already loaded in your environment and is called ha_data so
      you don't have to load it. 

- Class: text
  Output: As we said, the data includes patients' data on the presence of heart
      disease but also other characteristics such as demographic
      variables. The variable 'target' captures the presence of a heart disease.
      It is integer valued 0 = no/less chance of heart attack 
      and 1 = more chance of heart attack.
      
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Write a function that tells you how many variables are in the dataset.
  CorrectAnswer: ncol(ha_data)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = ncol(ha_data))
  Hint: There are various ways to do this. Function nrow() gives you the number
      of rows in the dataset. Find which function gives you the number of columns
      in a dataset.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's take a look at the dataset by using the function head().
  CorrectAnswer: head(ha_data)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = head(ha_data))
  Hint: You don't need a hint for this :)

- Class: text
  Output: Go to this link to read more about the variables in the dataset.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The variable chest pain (represented as cp in the data) takes 4 different
      types indicated by numbers from 1-4. Becuase cp is a categorical variable but
      summarized by numbers, we can't use it directly in our regression because
      the regression models is going to assume it's a numerical variable rather
      than categorical. So we need to convert this variable to categorical using
      the as.factor() function. Use this function on the variable and save the result
      to the same object ha_data$cp.
  CorrectAnswer: ha_data$cp <- as.factor(ha_data$cp)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ha_data$cp <- as.factor(ha_data$cp)')
  Hint: Make sure you use "<-" for assignment and not "=".

- Class: text
  Output: Now, let's get ready to do some regression analysis. Because the outcome
      variable (target) is binary, we will use a logistic regression in order to 
      predict it. Press any key to continue!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's split the data to test and train. For that, you can simply run
      this code train_ind = sort(sample(nrow(ha_data), nrow(ha_data)*.5)). 
      This code just creates the indices for the training data.
  CorrectAnswer: train_ind <- sort(sample(nrow(ha_data), nrow(ha_data)*.5))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('train_ind <- sort(sample(nrow(ha_data), nrow(ha_data)*.5))')
  Hint: Just copy and run the code in the question text with the semicolons in between.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's create the training set by using the indices we created in
      previous step. You can simply run the code ha_train<-ha_data[train_ind,]
  CorrectAnswer: ha_train <- ha_data[train_ind,]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ha_train <- ha_data[train_ind,]')
  Hint: Just copy and run the code in the question text with the semicolons in between.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, let's create the test set by using the indices we created in
      previous step. You can simply run the code ha_test<-ha_data[-train_ind,]
  CorrectAnswer: ha_test <- ha_data[-train_ind,]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ha_test <- ha_data[-train_ind,]')
  Hint: Just copy and run the code in the question text with the semicolons in between.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To perform logistic regression, we use the glm() function instead of 
      the usual lm() function we've been using so far for regression analysis. glm
      stands for generalized linear models. glm() works the same way as lm() except
      at the end, you should determine the family of model you would like to use.
      We're going to use logistic regression, so we use family = binomial at the end.
      Note that we'll be using the ha_train data.
      Let's regress target on age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps),
      cholestoral (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic 
      results (restecg), and maximum heart rate achieved (thalach). Save the result
      to an object called logistic01.
  CorrectAnswer: logistic01 <- glm(target ~ age + sex + cp + trestbps + chol + fbs + restecg + thalach, data = ha_train, family = binomial)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('logistic01 <- glm(target ~ age + sex + cp + trestbps + chol + fbs + restecg + thalach, data = ha_train, family = binomial)', 'logistic01 <- glm(target ~ age + sex + cp + trestbps + chol + fbs + restecg + thalach, data = ha_train, family = "binomial")', 'logistic01 <- glm(target ~ age + sex + cp + trestbps + chol + fbs + restecg + thalach, family = "binomial", data = ha_train)', 'logistic01 <- glm(target ~ age + sex + cp + trestbps + chol + fbs + restecg + thalach, family = binomial, data = ha_train)', 'logistic01 <- glm(ha_train$target ~ ha_train$age + ha_train$sex + ha_train$cp + ha_train$trestbps + ha_train$chol + ha_train$fbs + ha_train$restecg + ha_train$thalach, family = binomial)')
  Hint: Make sure you specify the family as binomial and that you are using the 
      data ha_train. Also did you save the 
      result to the object name? Also, while the order of variables in a 
      regression in R is not important, it's important in swirl. Please enter them
      in the order specified above.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can see how good our model is by going "in the wild" and using 
      the model with the test daya. The predict() function can be used to 
      predict the probability that a person will have a heart disease, given 
      values of the predictors using the test data ha_test. So make sure you 
      use the argument newdata = ha_test.
      In using the function, we specify type="response" option which tells R 
      to output everything in terms of probabilities rather than the logistic
      values of Y. Use the function and find store the results to an object
      called predicted_vals.
  CorrectAnswer: predicted_vals <- predict(logistic01, type="response", newdata = ha_test)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('predicted_vals <- predict(logistic01, type="response", newdata = ha_test)', 'predicted_vals <- predict(logistic01, newdata = ha_test, type="response")')
  Hint: Make sure you specify type as "response" and use argument newdata = ha_test. Also did you save the results
      into an object?
      
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The object predicted_vals that we just created is a vector. Let's look
      the first 10 elements of the vector.
  CorrectAnswer: predicted_vals[1:10]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('predicted_vals[1:10]', 'head(predicted_vals, 10)')
  Hint: Did you use brackets?

- Class: text
  Output: The predicted values that we estimated using the test data in the 
      previous step are numbers that can be anything between 0 and 1. 
      These predicted values are NOT really comparable to the observed outcomes 
      stored in the variable 'target' in the test data that are either 0 or 1.
      In the next step, we will convert the predicted values to values of 0 
      and 1 for better comparison.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To convert the predicted values to only zeros and ones, we can set a rule.
      We can say that if the predicted outcomes are less than 0.5, change them to 0,
      and if they are equal or greater than 0.5, change them to 1. This is an arbitrary
      rule but it'll help us compare the predicted and the observed outcomes. Run
      this code without modifying it predicted_vals_binary <- ifelse(predicted_vals < 0.5, 0, 1)
      which basically creates a new variable that is 0 for observations of predicted_Vals
      that are less than 0.5 and 1 otherwise.
  CorrectAnswer: predicted_vals_binary <- ifelse(predicted_vals < 0.5, 0, 1)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('predicted_vals_binary <- ifelse(predicted_vals < 0.5, 0, 1)')
  Hint: Did you run predicted_vals_binary <- ifelse(predicted_vals < 0.5, 0, 1)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can now compare the predicted outcomes to the observed outcomes. Let's
      create a table that shows the values of the binary predicted outcome
      (predicted_vals_binary) against the observed outcome (ha_test$target). See
      how you can use the table() function.
  CorrectAnswer: table(predicted_vals_binary, ha_test$target)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('table(predicted_vals_binary, ha_test$target)')
  Hint: Make sure you first input predicted values and then the observed values in
      the table function.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The table should show what percentage of those who didn't have heart
      disease but our model predicted as having a heart disease and vice versa.
      Do you think the accuracy of our model is satisfactory?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: Look at the summary of your regression by using the summary() function,
      and look at the last column.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
