  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 17, Statistical Matching II.
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

  Output: In this exercise, we will continue on the topic of Matching. 
      First, we will review simple matching with different M values. Then, we will move on to genetic matching. 
      We will try to interpret the match balance result to see how well we have matched our units.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Before you start this lesson, please download and load the dataset dw_data.dta from the Forum.
      This dataset contains 445 treated units and 15992 control units. 
      Make sure you name the dataset "df". 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We are not doing propensity score matching, so no need for that model this time.
      Let's define X, the covariates we want to match on.
      Use the cbind() function to combine age, age, education, black, hispanic, married, nodegree, re74, and re75.
  CorrectAnswer: X <- cbind(df$age, df$education, df$black, df$hispanic, df$married, df$nodegree, df$re74, df$re75)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('X <- cbind(df$age, df$education, df$black, df$hispanic, df$married, df$nodegree, df$re74, df$re75)') 
  Hint: Make sure you use df$age to specify the age var. Make sure the var order is as stated above.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's define Tr, the treatment variable.
  CorrectAnswer: Tr <- df$treat
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('Tr <- df$treat') 
  Hint: Treatment variable is called "treat" in this dataset.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we're ready to run the matching procedure. 
      You should have some practice on how to match, so I will leave it to you to do so.
      Specify the treatment, the covariates, and the number of matches to look for (M), in that order.
      Save this to an object called rr1. 
  CorrectAnswer: rr1 <- Match(Tr = Tr, X = X, M = 1)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('rr1 <- Match(Tr = Tr, X = X, M = 1)')
  Hint: 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: After we run the Match() function, let's check whether the matched units are similar with the MatchBalance() function.
      In the function, 1) specify the model, treat ~ age..., 2) specify the dataset, 3) set the match.out to the match object rr, and 4) set nboots to 500. 
      Save it to an object called mb1.
  CorrectAnswer: mb1 <- MatchBalance(treat~ age + education + black + hispanic + married + nodegree + re74 + re75, data = df, match.out=rr1, nboots=500)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mb1 <- MatchBalance(treat~ age + education + black + hispanic + married + nodegree + re74 + re75, data = df, match.out=rr1, nboots=500)')
  Hint: Use this, mb1 <- MatchBalance(treat~ age + education + black + hispanic + married + nodegree + re74 + re75, data = df, match.out=rr1, nboots=500)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Did the balance improve after matching? (Hint, look at the variables that have small p-values before/after matching.)
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint:

- Class: text
  Output: Before matching, 7 variables have poor balance (small p-values). After matching, only 1 variable has that small p-value. 
      Hence, we have an improvement in balance between our treatment and control group. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's repeat the matching procedure, but change M to 3. 
      M indicates the number of matches found for each control/treatment unit. 
      Save this to an object called rr3. 
  CorrectAnswer: rr3 <- Match(Tr = Tr, X = X, M = 3)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('rr3 <- Match(Tr = Tr, X = X, M = 3)')
  Hint: Same as before, but change the M parameter to 3.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Run the same MatchBalance() function, but change the match.out parameter to reflect this new matching procedure.
      Save it to an object called mb3. 
  CorrectAnswer: mb3 <- MatchBalance(treat~ age + education + black + hispanic + married + nodegree + re74 + re75, data = df, match.out=rr3, nboots=500)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mb3 <- MatchBalance(treat~ age + education + black + hispanic + married + nodegree + re74 + re75, data = df, match.out=rr3, nboots=500)')
  Hint: Same as before, but change the match.out parameter to rr3.

- Class: text
  Output: Look at the MatchBalance result and consider whether this has a better balance compared to M=1. 

- Class: text
  Output: Now the interesting method, genetic matching.
      This procedure has one additional step. Simple matching has the Match() and the MatchBalance step.
      Genetic matching has a GenMatch() step before these steps.
      (You can run ?GenMatch for the documentation.)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's run the Genmatch step. 
      In the arguments, specify the treatment, the covariates, the estimand ("ATT"), M (1), pop.size (16), max.generations (10), wait.generations (5).
      Save the object to genout.
  CorrectAnswer: genout <- GenMatch(Tr=Tr, X=X, estimand="ATT", M=1, pop.size=16, max.generations=10, wait.generations=5)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('genout <- GenMatch(Tr=Tr, X=X, estimand="ATT", M=1, pop.size=16, max.generations=10, wait.generations=5)')
  Hint: If you can't figure it out, just paste this, genout <- GenMatch(Tr=Tr, X=X, estimand="ATT", M=1, pop.size=16, max.generations=10, wait.generations=5)

- Class: text
  Output: If there are any confusion on the things you put in the GenMatch function, bring the question to class.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We will then input the GenMatch output (which we named genout) to the Match function. 
      Be sure to specify Tr, X, M, estimand, and set Weight.matrix as genout.
      Save this to an object called mout.
  CorrectAnswer: mout <- Match(Tr=Tr, X=X, M=1, estimand="ATT", Weight.matrix=genout)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mout <- Match(Tr=Tr, X=X, M=1, estimand="ATT", Weight.matrix=genout)')
  Hint: 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, we can check the balance of the genetic matching procedure. 
      The things you put into the MatchBalance function is the same as before, except you specify match.out as mout. 
      Save this to an object called mbgen. 
  CorrectAnswer: mbgen <- MatchBalance(treat~ age + education + black + hispanic + married + nodegree + re74 + re75, data = df, match.out=mout, nboots=500)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mbgen <- MatchBalance(treat~ age + education + black + hispanic + married + nodegree + re74 + re75, data = df, match.out=mout, nboots=500)')
  Hint: 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Looking at the match balance result (mainly the min. p-values and the number of variables with the p-values), 
      how does the balance compare to our previous attempts? 
  AnswerChoices: It's better!;It's worse!
  CorrectAnswer: It's better!
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="It's better!")
  Hint:

- Class: text
  Output: From the p-value, we see that the minimum p-value is 0.024 instead of 2.22e-16 (remember that larger p-values are better in the matching context).
      From the number of variables we small p-values, we also see that it decreased from 7 variables to 1 variable. 

- Class: text
  Output: Good job! This was a long lesson, but you made it this far!

  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
